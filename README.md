This is my favorite project to showcase my abilities! This is a simple to-do list.
You can add case. If you click on a case, it will be active, or you can delete the case by clicking the delete button!
In the total field we have the total number of cases.
In the active field, we have the total number of active cases.
Both of these fields change dynamically, depending on the actions!
The project was created based on HTML, CSS and pure Javascript (without libraries)
